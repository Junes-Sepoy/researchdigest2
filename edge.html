                    <p>Following the incredible response to our previous editions, we've changed things. Along with Edge for early career therapists, we're now launching The Edge for therapists who have 4-6 years of experience as well.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Edge is designed by therapists, for therapists. The first line in our Kaha manifesto reads: we take our work VERY seriously (Ourselves, not so much). And that is what we aim to bring to you. Get ready for thought-provoking discussions, direct access to our lead therapists, hands-on learning with practical assignments, and an environment where your opinions *matter*. This is your space to grow, and you'll be encouraged to ask questions and take up space. No question is too shallow, and no topic too deep. By the end, you'll walk away feeling confident and READY to become the best version of your therapist self.</p>

                    <h3>Who Will Conduct the Course? 🧑‍🏫</h3>
                    <p>You're in great hands! Your supervisors and instructors bring a wealth of experience to this course. They hold PhDs, M.Phils, and Master's degrees from some of the most prestigious universities around the world and in India. With backgrounds in universities, hospitals, program development at organizational and community levels, and extensive work with diverse individuals, they've supervised therapists like you who have become experts in the field.</p>
                    
                    <p>Together they bring perspectives from diverse sets of therapeutic orientations including CBT, DBT, ACT, Narrative, TA, MBCT and so much more. And of course, it's a given that they're trauma-informed, queer-affirmative and culturally sensitive. So don't hold back and hit them with your toughest questions- they've got you covered. They are all a part of Kaha's leadership team (we've only got the best lined up for you). They've been there, done that, see the gaps that exist and are well-equipped to guide you through all of it.</p>
