                    <h3>For Individuals</h3>
                    
                    <p>Considering therapy but not quite sure what's in store for you? Well, then you've come to the right place! Life can be a rollercoaster, and sometimes we need a compassionate hand to navigate the ups and downs. Whether you're dealing with anxiety, depression, relationship struggles, trauma, life transitions, or anything else, we're here to help. Our team is made up of adolescents and adults. We're about creating a space (accessible both online and in person) where you can feel heard, understood, and empowered.</p>
                    
                    <p>We get it. The hunt for the "right" therapist can be challenging, to say the least. Don't worry, we've got you covered. Our therapists are all highly-experienced professionals with a diverse range of specializations, all united by a common goal: your well-being. Our priority is to pair you with a therapist who fits your needs, no matter what those are.</p>
                    
                    <p class="section-header">What we offer:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Individual Therapy:</strong> Individual therapy is a safe, confidential space to explore your unique experiences. Through one-on-one sessions with a qualified therapist, you'll gain tools and strategies to navigate challenges and improve your well-being.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Couples Therapy:</strong> Relationships can be tricky. We're here to help you and your partner navigate through communication barriers, trust issues, and more, fostering a deeper connection and understanding.</p>
                    
                    <p class="note">P.S. If you're looking for the kind of therapist you see on TV - with deadpan faces who respond to everything with a monotonous "How did you feel about that?" - that's probably not us. We believe therapy should be relatable and human, just like you. So don't be surprised if your therapist shares a laugh with you over a silly joke or even discusses the latest meme that's been making you smile.</p>

                    <h3>For Organizations</h3>
                    
                    <p>Today's workplaces face a constant juggling act: fostering inclusion, building resilience, maintaining productivity and so much more. It's no surprise that employee well-being often gets overlooked. But businesses are realizing that stressed-out employees don't exist, and neglecting mental health is a recipe for disaster.</p>
                    
                    <p>We're proud to be the trusted mental health and emotional wellness partner for a variety of organizations. We partner with some of the most innovative (and yes, pretty awesome) companies to support their teams. While we work with folk we encourage work with. We can't name-drop, you're probably here because of referees the folks we currently work with.</p>
